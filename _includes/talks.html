            <p><a href="https://aidx-lab.org/">Berthold Bauml</a> is head of the Autonomous Learning Robots Lab. His longterm goal in this basic research lab is to use learning as the core principle in building really autonomous robots which can operate in complex and changing environments. A prerequisite for this research program is robotic hardware which comes close to human performance with respect to sensor and motor capabilities and has a realtime connection to large and scalable computing resources. In the last years we upgraded one of our torque controlled humanoid robots to our award winning research platform Agile Justin [2] which, among others, now has realtime 3D environment modeling, high resolution spatio-temporal tactile sensing on the whole body and the hands and a wirelessly coupled GPU cluster in-the-loop.</p>
