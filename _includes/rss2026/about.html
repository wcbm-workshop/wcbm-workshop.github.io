          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            Humanoid robots have long held promise to be seamlessly deployed in our daily lives. Despite the rapid progress in humanoid robots' hardware (e.g. Boston Dynamics Atlas, Tesla Optimus, Unitree H1, 1X Neo, Agility Digit), their software is fully or partially hand-designed for specific tasks. The goal of <i>Whole-body Control and Bimanual Manipulation (WCBM)</i> workshop is to provide a platform for roboticists and machine learning researchers to discuss the past achievements of whole-body control and manipulation as well as future research directions on this topic, especially on the problem of enabling autonomous humanoid robots. We invited a group of speakers who are world-renowned experts to present their work on whole-body control for humanoid robots and bimanual robotic systems. We also want to provide researchers with the opportunity to present their latest research by accepting workshop papers. We will review and select the best submissions for spotlight talks and interactive poster presentations. We have also planned guided panel discussions to encourage debate among the invited speakers and workshop participants. In the discussion, we would like to contrast the viewpoints of machine learning researchers and roboticists on the past and future of this research topic.
